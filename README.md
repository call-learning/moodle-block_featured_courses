# Featured courses #

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/call-learning/moodle-block-featured_courses.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/call-learning/moodle-block-featured_courses)

A block to display of courses from the global list of courses.

Once added, you will then be able to select a set of courses from the list of all courses.

# Features #

* Allow to remove the last course from the list if too many courses are added.
* Integrates with the module local_syllabus if enabled and present.

# TODO

* Test for higher load of courses in the edit form ( we might be able to do this in ajax instead of loading all courses in memory )
